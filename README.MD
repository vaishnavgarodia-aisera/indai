<B> Intelligent Natural Dialouge AI (INDAI) is a cutting-edge tech software out of the AISERA Palo Alto office, awaiting imminent patent approval on a next-generation speech technology that has both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now, the INDAI stock trades over the counter at 10 cents a share but our top analysts here have a price target of 50 cents a share within the next eight months. We're talking a potential return of 5 times your money. We rarely say this about a stock, but INDAI is a real winner. We always tell our clients, do not judge us on our successes, but rather judge us on our failures, because we have so few of them" </B>
